When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share its content to other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    

Because you can control what you pull from remote repository since not only you can modify or add content.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you 
use one instead of another?

   

Fork command is used to clone a GitHub repository into GitHub. Clone command clones a remote repository into a local one. 
Finally, branch is a label that group many commits. You can use fork when you want to clone someone else repository and working on it.
I would use fork when you want to colaborate with someone else and you want this content shared. On the other hand you want to clone a repository into your local machine
when you want to perform changes on your local machine using last content from remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

 

The benefit is that you are sure you are working on an updated file.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

 

You can collaborate by using pull requests. Pull request allows you to suggest a change to the person in charge of update the changes to the main repository.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

 

When you want to developer something different, a different concept of the code you are working on for example, and you want not to include it directly to the main code.
The benefit of this approach is that this allows your to test different option for a problem without introduce bugs to the main branch.
